    My name is<b> Ganesh Biswa</b>. I was born in march 9, 1999. I have 2 older sisters along with 1 little brother. My parents were born and raised in Bhutan. But my birth was in Nepal in a small refugee camp called <B>Khudhuna Bari</b>. There were more than 20,000 people. Life in a camp was hard because of situations. It was hard for my parent to provide food and clothes for us. Sometimes we would sleep without eating. My parents were only able to buy us new cloth once a year. Even though life was hard, everyone in the camp were<strong> happy</strong> with what we had.

    In 2008, we start hearing about<em> IOM</em>. It is an international organization for migration to help all refugees to give them new life in different countires around the world. My parents did not wanted to leave Nepal. But in 2012, my parents finally sign paperworks to come to United States. The process took over a year. We had to go through lot of history and medical check up. Therefore, we landed in USA on January 22, 2013.

    <i> I love playing soccer and listening to music. I have broken my hand couple of times playing soccer back in Nepal. We played soccer with plastic balls which is really fun to play while raining. I usually listen to bollyhood musics because they are my favorite. I had lots of friends back in Nepal. One of the thing that really disappointed me in the camp was the poor medical support. We did not had good hospital or pharmacy. Our hospitals were made out bambooes and it could not fit much people. As a child, all the situation and issues in the camp allowed me to focus lot toward my education.</i>

       My hobby is watching videos on youtube. This might sound weird but I spend most of my free times watching youtube videos. This is what I enjoy the most.
       you may ask what you watch in youtube? Well, I watch lots tutorial videos especially how to do video edits. My another hobby is taking videos. I try to 
       hangout with people with cameras. So, I can be part of their group when taking film shoot, and farthermore.

        <h2>Quotes</h2>
        <blockquote cite="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes">
            <p> <strong>These are the quotes that I like:</strong><p>
     <p>   “I'm selfish, impatient and a little insecure. I make mistakes, I am out of control and at times hard to handle. But if you can't handle me at my worst, then you sure as hell don't deserve me at my best.” ― Marilyn Monroe<p>

        <p>  “Be who you are and say what you feel, because those who mind don't matter, and those who matter don't mind.” 
            ― Bernard M. Baruch </p>

        <p> “I believe that everything happens for a reason. People change so that you can learn to let go, things go wrong so that you appreciate them when they're right, you believe lies so you eventually learn to trust no one but yourself, and sometimes good things fall apart so better things can fall together.” 
            ― Marilyn Monroe  </p>
